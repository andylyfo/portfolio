### PROJECTS

<br><br>
Here is a recent selection of data and developer projects, as well as a short summary of my Master's thesis in climate modelling.

[James Ward-Prowse: All Free Kicks Analysed](http://example.com/)
<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>
<br><br>
A short project to brighten my mood as a fan of (at the time) struggling Southampton. James Ward-Prowse seems destined to break the premier league free kick record so I wanted to see if I could analyse them from a data perspective to gain insight on his best location and angle. To find his 'territory', as it were. First this involved using some tutorials to write a __web scraping API__ to pull all the shot data for every attempt (including open play) from [Understat](https://understat.com/player/843). The next step was cleaning and stripping the data down to just his free kick attempts and the essentials. Then it was a simple case of plotting the data with __Python__ and it's packages. The findings were enlightening.

[Browser Boids](https://andylyfo.github.io/boids/)
<img src="images/murmuration.jpg?raw=true"/>
<br><br>
I've always been enamoured by the migratory activity of starlings (who isn't?) known as murmurations, so I set out to make my own version that I can view from my desktop rather than a 4 hour journey down to Brighton beach. Upon the pleasing discovery that this was a well trodden corner of computer science (in particular game design), I built my own simulation with __JavaScipt/HTML/CSS__ to work in a browser window. Sit back and relax. This was adapted from Ben Eater's work, the repo is [here](https://github.com/andylyfo/boids).

### Writing

I try to keep my pen sharp by publishing a food-related journal called TRIPE on substack. TRIPE being a synonym for nonsense, naturally.
