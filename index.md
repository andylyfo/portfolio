I've always been enamoured by the migratory activity of starlings (who isn't?) known as murmurations, so I set out to make my own version. Upon the pleasing discovery that this was a well trodden corner of computer science (in particular game design), I built my own simulation to work in a browser window. Sit back and relax.

### Writing

I try to keep my pen sharp by publishing a food-related journal called TRIPE on substack. TRIPE being a synonym for nonsense, naturally.
